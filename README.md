A powerful adaptive graphics settings system for Godot 4.4 that automatically adjusts visual quality based on performance to maintain a smooth framerate.

## Features

- **User-friendly UI**: Built-in settings panel for players to customize their experience
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking and performance analysis
- **Platform-specific Optimizations**: Detects and applies optimal settings for different devices
- **Fully Customizable**: Extensive configuration options for developers

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `addons/smart_graphics_settings` folder into your Godot project's `addons` directory
3. Enable the plugin in Project Settings â†’ Plugins

## Quick Start

1. Add the SmartGraphicsSettings node to your main scene or use the autoload singleton
2. Configure your desired target FPS and adjustment settings
3. Run your game - graphics will automatically adjust to maintain performance

```gdscript
# Access the SmartGraphicsSettings singleton directly
# No need for get_node() as it's registered as an autoload

# Enable or disable adaptive graphics
SmartGraphicsSettings.adaptive_graphics.enabled = true

# Set target FPS
SmartGraphicsSettings.adaptive_graphics.target_fps = 60

# Show the settings UI
SmartGraphicsSettings.toggle_ui()
```
