# Smart Graphics Settings for Godot 4.4

A powerful adaptive graphics settings system for Godot 4.4 that automatically adjusts visual quality based on performance to maintain a smooth framerate.

## Features

- **Adaptive Quality**: Automatically adjusts graphics settings to maintain target FPS
- **Comprehensive Settings Management**: Controls render scale, anti-aliasing, shadows, reflections, and more
- **User-friendly UI**: Built-in settings panel for players to customize their experience
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking and performance analysis
- **Platform-specific Optimizations**: Detects and applies optimal settings for different devices
- **Fully Customizable**: Extensive configuration options for developers

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `addons/smart_graphics_settings` folder into your Godot project's `addons` directory
3. Enable the plugin in Project Settings â†’ Plugins

## Quick Start

1. Add the SmartGraphicsSettings node to your main scene or use the autoload singleton
2. Configure your desired target FPS and adjustment settings
3. Run your game - graphics will automatically adjust to maintain performance

# Access the SmartGraphicsSettings singleton directly

# Enable or disable adaptive graphics
SmartGraphicsSettings.set_enabled(true)

# Set target FPS
SmartGraphicsSettings.set_target_fps(60)

# Show the settings UI
SmartGraphicsSettings.toggle_ui()

## Important Note on Initialization

When accessing `SmartGraphicsSettings` properties like `adaptive_graphics` or calling functions like `set_target_fps` immediately in your script's `_ready()` function, you might encounter issues because the addon performs some initialization steps deferred (after `_ready()` has finished).

To ensure the system is fully initialized before you interact with it at startup, connect to the `SmartGraphicsSettings.initialized` signal:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	if SmartGraphicsSettings.get_adaptive_graphics(): # Check if already initialized
		_on_graphics_ready()
	else:
		SmartGraphicsSettings.initialized.connect(_on_graphics_ready)

func _on_graphics_ready():
	# Now it's safe to access SmartGraphicsSettings functions and properties
	print("Smart Graphics Settings Ready!")
	SmartGraphicsSettings.set_target_fps(90)
```

See the [technical documentation](addons/smart_graphics_settings/README.md#handling-initialization-timing) for more details.

## Demo
