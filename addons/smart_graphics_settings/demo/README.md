# Smart Graphics Settings Demo

This demo showcases the Smart Graphics Settings extension for Godot 4.4. It provides a simple 3D scene with various objects and a stress test feature to demonstrate how the adaptive graphics system automatically adjusts visual quality to maintain performance.

## Features

- **Basic 3D Scene**: Simple scene with various 3D primitives
- **Stress Test**: Press Space to spawn 100 additional objects to test performance adaptation
- **Quality Presets**: Press 1-5 to quickly switch between quality presets
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays current FPS, stability, and system status
- **Settings UI**: Press F7 to toggle the built-in settings panel

## How to Use

1. Open the demo scene in Godot 4.4
2. Run the scene
3. Press F7 to open the settings UI
4. Try different quality presets using the 1-5 keys
5. Press Space to add 100 more objects and stress the renderer
6. Watch how the system automatically adjusts settings to maintain performance

## Implementation Details

The demo scene demonstrates how to:

1. **Initialize the Smart Graphics Settings system**:

   ```gdscript
   # Get the SmartGraphicsSettings singleton
   settings = get_node("/root/SmartGraphicsSettings")
   ```

2. **Apply quality presets**:

   ```gdscript
   # Apply a quality preset (0=ULTRA_LOW, 4=ULTRA)
   settings.apply_preset(preset_index)
   ```

3. **Monitor performance**:

   ```gdscript
   # Get current performance metrics
   var avg_fps: float = settings.get_average_fps()
   var is_stable: bool = settings.is_fps_stable()
   ```

4. **Get detailed status information**:

   ```gdscript
   # Get comprehensive status information
   var info: Dictionary = settings.get_status_info()
   ```

5. **Show the settings UI**:

   ```gdscript
   # Show the built-in settings UI
   settings.show_ui()
   ```

## FPS Stability Indicator

The demo includes an improved FPS stability indicator that shows whether your frame rate is stable or unstable:

- **Stable**: Indicates that the FPS has low variance and is consistent
- **Unstable**: Indicates that the FPS is fluctuating significantly

The stability is determined using both variance and coefficient of variation (CV) calculations, which provide a more accurate representation of FPS stability across different frame rate ranges.

## Customizing the Demo

You can modify this demo to test different scenarios:

- Change the `spawn_count` variable to adjust how many objects are spawned at once
- Add more complex 3D models to increase rendering load
- Adjust the stress test to spawn different types of objects
- Modify the camera movement to test different viewing angles
- Add post-processing effects to test their performance impact

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the demo:

1. Make sure the Smart Graphics Settings plugin is enabled in Project Settings â†’ Plugins
2. Check the console for any error messages
3. Verify that the SmartGraphicsSettings singleton is properly registered
4. Ensure your Godot version is 4.4 or higher
